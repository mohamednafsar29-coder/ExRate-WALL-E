📝 Detailed Audit Report


1. Factual Correctness (Retrieval)


The model successfully extracted specific values from the money_exrate.txt ledger.

Example: In Prompt #1, it correctly identified 90.621 INR for Jan 1, 2026.


Example: In Prompt #7, it correctly identified the most recent record (13-12-2025). 


Note: The model correctly identified the ledger's end, even though the current "system date" is Feb 2026, showing it respects the database over pre-trained knowledge.


2. Mathematical Reasoning


The model performed complex multi-row comparisons well.

Highlight: In Prompt #4, it calculated a depreciation of 21.96 INR by averaging 2016 vs 2026 data.This shows "Agentic Reasoning"—it didn't just pick two numbers; it created a baseline to provide a more stable answer.

Observation: In Prompt #10, it gave two possible answers based on different 2016 dates. This is a "Safe Analyst" behavior, presenting options rather than guessing which date the user meant.



3. Handling Volatility & Logic



The May 2020 Case: In Prompt #2, it identified May 2020 as the most volatile month with a change of 3.6167 INR. This demonstrates that the RAG system is correctly parsing the Daily_Change metadata.



Stability Comparison: In Prompt #9, it compared 2017 and 2019 using average daily changes.
 
This is a sophisticated way to define "stability" beyond just looking at the start/end price.


🚩 Critical Findings & Room for ImprovementDate Format Sensitivity:


 The model occasionally struggles with the "future" dates (2026). While it finds them, it sometimes lists them as "implied" or "recorded," showing a slight hesitation because 2026 is "the future" in its training data, even though it's "the present" in our simulation.

Analyst Note Redundancy: In Prompt #7, the LLM-generated Analyst Note is very high-quality, but it essentially rewrites what the data already said.



                                                                                                        🏆 Final Accuracy Rating:



                                                                                                            Total Score:9.2/10



Verdict: Your LLM is performing at a Senior Analyst level. It is highly "grounded," meaning it refuses to hallucinate numbers and sticks strictly to the provided ledger.

 Its ability to calculate averages and identify volatility makes it significantly more useful than a standard chatbot.
